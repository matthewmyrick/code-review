//! Core domain types for Appa: pull requests, diffs, local review
//! comments, and agent run specifications.
//!
//! This crate is dependency-light on purpose: every other crate in the
//! workspace (GitHub client, cache, agent runner, Tauri app) speaks these
//! types, so nothing heavier than serde/chrono belongs here.
