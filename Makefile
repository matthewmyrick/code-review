# Fast, consistent entry points for agents and humans working in this
# repo. Resolves cargo/node/pnpm onto PATH itself — a fresh shell (e.g.
# an agent's sandboxed bash) often doesn't have either on PATH without
# manually sourcing nvm/cargo's env first, so every target here works
# with a bare `make <target>`, no setup step required.
#
# Every recipe line ends in `;` on purpose: macOS ships GNU Make 3.81
# (unmaintained since ~2006), which execs a "simple" command (no shell
# metacharacters) directly via execvp instead of routing it through a
# shell — and that direct exec doesn't see the PATH exported below. The
# trailing `;` forces shell invocation, which does.
